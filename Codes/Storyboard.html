            <h2>Focus and Design of My Website</h2>
            <p>The main focus of my website’s layout is to create a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface that makes navigation seamless and ensures an enjoyable experience. I’ve implemented a flexible design using CSS Flexbox and Wrap properties to ensure the layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience across all devices.</p>

            <h2>Color Scheme and Aesthetics</h2>
            <p>I’ve chosen a color scheme with various shades of green, symbolizing growth, energy, and innovation—values that reflect the purpose of my portfolio. Green is also strongly associated with technology and development, reinforcing the professional focus of my site. I’ve paired this with white and light backgrounds to create a minimalist, open atmosphere that keeps attention on the content without overwhelming the viewer.</p>
